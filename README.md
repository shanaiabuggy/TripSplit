# TripSplit
This is a website created for CSCI 3308-Software Development Methods and Tools. This website was created within a group of three people. My role in the group was to work on all front end development and design. The CSS framework used was Bootstrap.

TripSplit is a utility to track and manage group expenses (during a vacation, ski trip, etc). The app tracks the expenses for each person and calculates how much each person owes or is owed in the click of a button. It alleviates the nuisance of splitting multiple small costs throughout the duration of a trip, and rather see a clear split at the end of the trip. 

The original HTML design is located within the TripSplit folder. The most recent version of the complete website is located in the presentationCode folder. Within the presentationCode folder there is a folder for node, resources and views. Then there are the .json files and server.js for postgreSQL integration. The views folder has a pages folder inside of it, and inside of that there are the .ejs files for each page of the website. The resources folder contains the css and image files that are used.

Disclaimer: Functionality of the utility is incomplete at this time. The main take-away from this project is my design of the user interface.
