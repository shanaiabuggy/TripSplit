# TripSplit
This is a website created for CSCI 3308-Software Development Methods and Tools. This website was created within a group of three people. My role in the group was to work on all front end development. The CSS framework used was Bootstrap.

TripSplit is a utility to track and manage group expenses (during a vacation, ski trip, etc). The app tracks the expenses for each person and calculates how much each person owes or is owed in the click of a button. It alleviates the nuisance of splitting multiple small costs throughout the duration of a trip, and rather see a clear split at the end of the trip.
